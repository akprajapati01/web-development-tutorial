            <div>
            <p>A cement is a binder, a chemical substance used for construction that sets, hardens, and adheres to other materials to
            bind them together. Cement is seldom used on its own, but rather to bind sand and gravel (aggregate) together. Cement
            mixed with fine aggregate produces mortar for masonry, or with sand and gravel, produces concrete. Concrete is the most
            widely used material in existence and is behind only water as the planet's most-consumed resource.</p>
            
            <p>Cements used in construction are usually inorganic, often lime or calcium silicate based, which can be characterized
                as hydraulic or the less common non-hydraulic, depending on the ability of the cement to set in the presence of
                water (see hydraulic and non-hydraulic lime plaster).</p>

                    <li>  <h4>History of cement</h4></li>
                    
                    <p>The origin of hydraulic cements goes back to ancient Greece and Rome. The materials used were lime and a volcanic ash
                        that slowly reacted with it in the presence of water to form a hard mass. This formed the cementing material of the
                        Roman mortars and concretes of more than 2,000 years ago and of subsequent construction work in western Europe.
                        Volcanic ash mined near what is now the city of Pozzuoli, Italy, was particularly rich in essential aluminosilicate
                        minerals, giving rise to the classic pozzolana cement of the Roman era. To this day the term pozzolana, or pozzolan,
                        refers either to the cement itself or to any finely divided aluminosilicate that reacts with lime in water to form
                        cement. (The term cement, meanwhile, derives from the Latin word caementum, which meant stone chippings such as were
                        used in Roman mortar—not the binding material itself.)</p>
                    <li><h4>Manufacture of cement</h4></li>
                    
                    <P>There are four stages in the manufacture of portland cement: (1) crushing and grinding the raw materials, (2) blending the materials in the correct proportions, (3) burning the prepared mix in a kiln, and (4) grinding the burned product, known as “clinker,” together with some 5 percent of gypsum (to control the time of set of the cement). The three processes of manufacture are known as the wet, dry, and semidry processes and are so termed when the raw materials are ground wet and fed to the kiln as a slurry, ground dry and fed as a dry powder, or ground dry and then moistened to form nodules that are fed to the kiln.

                        It is estimated that around 4–8 percent of the world’s carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions come from the manufacture of
                        cement, making it a major contributor to global warming. Some of the solutions to these greenhouse gas emissions are
                        common to other sectors, such as increasing the energy efficiency of cement plants, replacing fossil fuels with
                        renewable energy, and capturing and storing the CO2 that is emitted. In addition, given that a significant portion of
                        the emissions are an intrinsic part of the production of clinker, novel cements and alternate formulations that reduce
                        the need for clinker are an important area of focus.</P>
                        
                        <li><h4>Applications of cement</h4></li>
                        
                    <P>Cements may be used alone (i.e., “neat,” as grouting materials), but the normal use is in mortar and concrete in
                        which the cement is mixed with inert material known as aggregate. Mortar is cement mixed with sand or crushed stone
                        that must be less than approximately 5 mm (0.2 inch) in size. Concrete is a mixture of cement, sand or other fine
                        aggregate, and a coarse aggregate that for most purposes is up to 19 to 25 mm (0.75 to 1 inch) in size, but the
                        coarse aggregate may also be as large as 150 mm (6 inches) when concrete is placed in large masses such as dams.
                        Mortars are used for binding bricks, blocks, and stone in walls or as surface renderings. Concrete is used for a
                        large variety of constructional purposes. Mixtures of soil and portland cement are used as a base for roads.
                        Portland cement also is used in the manufacture of bricks, tiles, shingles, pipes, beams, railroad ties, and various
                        extruded products. The products are prefabricated in factories and supplied ready for installation.</P>
